# quickframes

I am working on a School Management Sys 
I find myself having to cook up quick wireframes
To guide me when I code the frontend

Now, the wireframing tools I know are either too serious or expensive
quickframes is a wireframing tool that I want
it is goig to be unserious and free

I am going to write this in C
